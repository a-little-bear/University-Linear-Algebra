Polynomial algebra provides the fundamental language for studying linear operators. In linear algebra, we are concerned not so much with the analytical properties of polynomials as with their division, factorization, and their action on operators.

## 00.1 Fundamental Theory

!!! definition "Definition 00.1 (Polynomial Ring)"
    Let $F$ be a field. The polynomial ring $F[x]$ is the set of all expressions of the form $f(x) = \sum a_i x^i$, where $a_i \in F$.

!!! theorem "Theorem 00.1 (Division Algorithm)"
    For $f(x), g(x) \in F[x]$ with $g(x) \neq 0$, there exist unique $q(x), r(x)$ such that:
    $$f(x) = q(x)g(x) + r(x), \quad \deg r < \deg g \text{ or } r = 0$$

## Exercises

1. **[Division] Divide $x^4 + 3x^2 + 2$ by $x^2 + 1$. Find the quotient $q(x)$ and remainder $r(x)$.**
   ??? success "Solution"
       $x^4 + 3x^2 + 2 = (x^2 + 2)(x^2 + 1) + 0$.
       Thus $q(x) = x^2 + 2$ and $r(x) = 0$. This shows $x^2+1$ is a factor.

2. **[GCD] Find the greatest common divisor of $f(x) = x^3 - 1$ and $g(x) = x^2 - 1$.**
   ??? success "Solution"
       $x^3 - 1 = (x-1)(x^2+x+1)$.
       $x^2 - 1 = (x-1)(x+1)$.
       The common factor is $(x-1)$, so $\gcd(f, g) = x-1$.

3. **[Bezout] Explain why if $\gcd(f, g) = 1$, there exist $u(x), v(x)$ such that $uf + vg = 1$.**
   ??? success "Solution"
       This is the Bezout identity for polynomials. Since $F[x]$ is a Principal Ideal Domain (PID), the ideal generated by two coprime polynomials contains 1, implying a linear combination equals 1.

4. **[Roots and Factors] Prove: $a$ is a root of $f(x)$ if and only if $(x-a)$ divides $f(x)$.**
   ??? success "Solution"
       By the division algorithm: $f(x) = (x-a)q(x) + r$, where $r$ is a constant.
       Setting $x=a$ gives $f(a) = 0 + r$. If $f(a)=0$, then $r=0$, so $(x-a) \mid f(x)$.

5. **[Fundamental Theorem] Over the complex field $\mathbb{C}$, how many roots does a polynomial of degree $n$ have (counting multiplicities)?**
   ??? success "Solution"
       According to the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra, every complex polynomial of degree $n \ge 1$ has exactly $n$ roots in $\mathbb{C}$. This means every complex polynomial can be factored into linear terms.

6. **[Multiple Roots] How can you use the derivative $f'(x)$ to check if $f(x)$ has multiple roots?**
   ??? success "Solution"
       $a$ is a multiple root of $f(x)$ if and only if $f(a) = 0$ and $f'(a) = 0$. More generally, the roots of $\gcd(f, f')$ are the multiple roots of $f$.

7. **[Matrix Polynomial] If $A = \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 2 \end{pmatrix}$, compute $p(A)$ where $p(x) = x^2 - 1$.**
   ??? success "Solution"
       $p(A) = A^2 - I = \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 4 \end{pmatrix} - \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 3 \end{pmatrix}$.

8. **[Cayley-Hamilton Intro] Let $A$ be a $2 \times 2$ matrix with characteristic polynomial $p(x)$. What is $p(A)$?**
   ??? success "Solution"
       According to the Cayley-Hamilton theorem, $p(A) = O$ (the zero matrix). A matrix always satisfies its own characteristic equation.

9. **[Irreducibility] Determine if $x^2 + 1$ is irreducible over $\mathbb{R}[x]$ and $\mathbb{C}[x]$.**
   ??? success "Solution"
       - Irreducible over $\mathbb{R}[x]$ because it has no real roots.
       - Reducible over $\mathbb{C}[x]$ as it can be factored into $(x+i)(x-i)$.

10. **[Lagrange Interpolation] Given three points $(0,1), (1,2), (2,5)$, does there exist a unique polynomial of degree $\le 2$ passing through them?**
    ??? success "Solution"
        Yes. According to Lagrange Interpolation, given $n+1$ distinct points, there exists a unique polynomial of degree at most $n$ that fits them. In this case, $p(x) = x^2 + 1$.

## Chapter Summary

This chapter establishes the foundation for operator algebra in linear algebra:

1. **Structural Consistency**: The algebraic structure of the polynomial ring (division, GCD) is highly analogous to the ring of integers.
2. **Theory of Roots**: Established the correspondence between roots and linear factors via the factorization theorem.
3. **Mapping Tools**: Extended scalar polynomials to matrix variables, setting the stage for the study of characteristic and minimal polynomials.
