Polynomial algebra is not merely an extension of elementary algebra but the fundamental language of linear operator theory. In linear algebra, we are concerned not just with evaluating polynomials but with their behavior as algebraic objects—division, factorization, and their action on operator spaces. This chapter systematically establishes the algebraic structure of $F[x]$, providing a solid foundation for the subsequent study of spectral theory.

## 00.1 Structure of the Polynomial Ring

!!! definition "Definition 00.1 (Polynomial Ring)"
    Let $F$ be a field. The polynomial ring $F[x]$ is the set of all expressions of the form $f(x) = \sum_{i=0}^n a_i x^i$, where $a_i \in F$.
    - If $a_n \neq 0$, then $\deg f = n$ is the **degree** of $f$.
    - A polynomial with $a_n = 1$ is called a **monic polynomial**.

!!! theorem "Theorem 00.1 (Division Algorithm)"
    For $f(x), g(x) \in F[x]$ with $g(x) \neq 0$, there exist unique $q(x), r(x) \in F[x]$ such that:
    $$f(x) = q(x)g(x) + r(x), \quad \deg r < \deg g \text{ or } r = 0$$
    This demonstrates that $F[x]$ is a **Euclidean Domain (ED)**.

!!! corollary "Corollary 00.1 (PID and UFD Properties)"
    Since $F[x]$ is a Euclidean Domain, it is necessarily:
    1.  **Principal Ideal Domain (PID)**: Every ideal in $F[x]$ can be generated by a single element.
    2.  **Unique Factorization Domain (UFD)**: Every non-zero, non-unit polynomial can be uniquely factored into a product of irreducible polynomials.

## 00.2 GCD and the Bezout Identity

!!! definition "Definition 00.2 (Greatest Common Divisor)"
    $d(x)$ is the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of $f(x)$ and $g(x)$, denoted $\gcd(f, g)$, if $d$ divides both $f$ and $g$, and any other common factor divides $d$. By convention, the monic GCD is chosen.

!!! theorem "Theorem 00.2 (Bezout's Identity)"
    Let $d(x) = \gcd(f, g)$. Then there exist polynomials $u(x), v(x) \in F[x]$ such that:
    $$u(x)f(x) + v(x)g(x) = d(x)$$
    In particular, if $\gcd(f, g) = 1$, $f$ and $g$ are said to be **coprime** (or relatively prime).

## 00.3 Roots and Factorization

!!! theorem "Theorem 00.3 (Remainder and Factor Theorems)"
    1.  The remainder of $f(x)$ divided by $(x - a)$ is equal to $f(a)$.
    2.  $(x - a)$ divides $f(x)$ if and only if $f(a) = 0$.

!!! theorem "Theorem 00.4 (Fundamental Theorem of Algebra)"
    Every complex polynomial of degree $n \geq 1$ has at least one root in $\mathbb{C}$. Consequently, any $f(z) \in \mathbb{C}[z]$ can be completely factored into $n$ linear terms:
    $$f(z) = c(z - \alpha_1)(z - \alpha_2) \cdots (z - \alpha_n)$$

## 00.4 Irreducibility Criteria

!!! theorem "Theorem 00.5 (Eisenstein's Criterion)"
    Let $f(x) = a_n x^n + a_{n-1} x^{n-1} + \cdots + a_0 \in \mathbb{Z}[x]$. If there exists a prime $p$ such that:
    1.  $p \nmid a_n$;
    2.  $p \mid a_i$ for all $i < n$;
    3.  $p^2 \nmid a_0$.
    Then $f(x)$ is irreducible over the field of rational numbers $\mathbb{Q}$.

## 00.5 Resultants and Discriminants

!!! definition "Definition 00.3 (Resultant)"
    The **Resultant** $\operatorname{Res}(f, g)$ of two polynomials $f$ and $g$ is the determinant of their Sylvester matrix.
    $\operatorname{Res}(f, g) = 0$ if and only if $f$ and $g$ share a common root in an algebraic closure.

## Exercises

1. **[Division] Divide $x^4 + 3x^2 + 2$ by $x^2 + 1$. Find the quotient $q(x)$ and remainder $r(x)$.**

   ??? success "Solution"
       $x^4 + 3x^2 + 2 = (x^2 + 2)(x^2 + 1) + 0$.
       Thus $q(x) = x^2 + 2$ and $r(x) = 0$. This shows $x^2+1$ is a factor.

2. **[GCD] Find the GCD of $f(x) = x^3 - 1$ and $g(x) = x^2 - 1$.**

   ??? success "Solution"
       $x^3 - 1 = (x-1)(x^2+x+1)$.
       $x^2 - 1 = (x-1)(x+1)$.
       The common factor is $(x-1)$, so $\gcd(f, g) = x-1$.

3. **[Bezout] Explain why if $\gcd(f, g) = 1$, there exist $u(x), v(x)$ such that $uf + vg = 1$.**

   ??? success "Solution"
       This is the Bezout identity. Since $F[x]$ is a Principal Ideal Domain (PID), the ideal generated by two coprime polynomials contains 1, implying a linear combination equals 1.

4. **[Roots] Prove: $a$ is a root of $f(x)$ if and only if $(x-a)$ divides $f(x)$.**

   ??? success "Solution"
       By the division algorithm: $f(x) = (x-a)q(x) + r$, where $r$ is a constant.
       Setting $x=a$ gives $f(a) = 0 + r$. If $f(a)=0$, then $r=0$, so $(x-a) \mid f(x)$.

5. **[Fundamental Theorem] Over $\mathbb{C}$, how many roots (counting multiplicities) does a polynomial of degree $n$ have?**

   ??? success "Solution"
       According to the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra, every complex polynomial of degree $n \ge 1$ has exactly $n$ roots in $\mathbb{C}$.

6. **[Multiple Roots] How can the derivative $f'(x)$ be used to check for multiple roots?**

   ??? success "Solution"
       $a$ is a multiple root of $f(x)$ if and only if $f(a) = 0$ and $f'(a) = 0$. In general, the roots of $\gcd(f, f')$ are the multiple roots of $f$.

7. **[Matrix Polynomial] If $A = \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 2 \end{pmatrix}$, compute $p(A)$ where $p(x) = x^2 - 1$.**

   ??? success "Solution"
       $p(A) = A^2 - I = \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 4 \end{pmatrix} - \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 3 \end{pmatrix}$.

8. **[Cayley-Hamilton] For a $2 \times 2$ matrix $A$ with characteristic polynomial $p(x)$, what is $p(A)$?**

   ??? success "Solution"
       By the Cayley-Hamilton Theorem, $p(A) = O$ (the zero matrix). Every matrix satisfies its own characteristic equation.

9. **[Irreducibility] Determine if $x^2 + 1$ is irreducible over $\mathbb{R}[x]$ and $\mathbb{C}[x]$.**

   ??? success "Solution"
       - Irreducible over $\mathbb{R}[x]$ as it has no real roots.
       - Reducible over $\mathbb{C}[x]$ as it factors into $(x+i)(x-i)$.

10. **[Eisenstein] Use $p=2$ to determine the irreducibility of $x^3 + 2x + 2$ over $\mathbb{Q}$.**

   ??? success "Solution"
        $p=2$ does not divide the leading coefficient 1, divides 2 and 2, and $p^2=4$ does not divide the constant term 2. The criterion is satisfied; thus, it is irreducible.

## Chapter Summary

This chapter establishes the foundation for operator algebra in linear algebra:

1.  **Structural Consistency**: The algebraic structure of the polynomial ring (division, GCD) is highly analogous to the ring of integers, both being Euclidean Domains.
2.  **Theory of Roots**: Established the correspondence between roots and linear factors; the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra guarantees the existence of eigenvalues for operators.
3.  **Mapping Tools**: Extended scalar polynomials to matrix variables, and through tools like resultants, prepared for the study of polynomial eigenvalue problems.
