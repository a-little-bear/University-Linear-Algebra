<div class="context-flow" markdown>

**Prerequisites**: Matrix Algebra (Ch2) · Fourier Transform (Ch30) · Polynomials (Ch0)

**Chapter Outline**: Toeplitz Matrices (Constant Diagonals) → Hankel Matrices (Constant Anti-diagonals) → Circulant Matrices → Eigenvalues of Circulant Matrices and DFT → Discrete Convolution → Displacement Structure → Levinson-Durbin Recursion → Szegő Limit Theorems

**Extension**: These matrices are the computational backbone of digital signal processing (filtering), time series analysis, and solving discretized differential equations.

Matrices with structural symmetry, such as **Toeplitz**, **Hankel**, and **Circulant** matrices, occur in systems where the interaction between components depends only on their relative displacement. A Toeplitz matrix has constant diagonals, while a circulant matrix is a special case where each row is a cyclic shift of the previous one. These structures are intimately linked to the **Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT)** and polynomial multiplication, allowing for super-fast algorithms ($O(n \log n)$) instead of the standard $O(n^2)$ or $O(n^3)$.

## 37A.1 Structural Definitions and Spectral Properties

!!! definition "Definition 37A.1 (Toeplitz and Circulant)"
    A matrix $T$ is **Toeplitz** if $T_{i,j} = t_{i-j}$.
    A matrix $C$ is **circulant** if $C_{i,j} = c_{(j-i) \pmod n}$.

!!! theorem "Theorem 37A.1 (Eigenvalues of Circulant Matrices)"
    Every circulant matrix $C$ is unitarily diagonalized by the DFT matrix $F$. The eigenvalues are the DFT of the first row of $C$:
    $$C = F^* \Lambda F, \quad 	ext{where } \Lambda = \operatorname{diag}(F \mathbf{c})$$

## Exercises

1. **[Fundamentals] Write the $3 	imes 3$ circulant matrix generated by the vector $(1, 2, 3)$.**
   ??? success "Solution"
       $C = \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 2 & 3 \ 3 & 1 & 2 \ 2 & 3 & 1 \end{pmatrix}$.

2. **[Toeplitz vs. Hankel] Show that $H$ is a Hankel matrix iff $HJ$ is a Toeplitz matrix, where $J$ is the exchange matrix (reverse identity).**
   ??? success "Solution"
       The exchange matrix $J$ reverses the order of columns. Since a Hankel matrix has constant anti-diagonals, reversing the columns aligns these constant entries along the standard diagonals, resulting in a Toeplitz matrix.

3. **[DFT Mapping] Compute the eigenvalues of the $3 	imes 3$ cyclic shift matrix $S = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 & 0 \ 0 & 0 & 1 \ 1 & 0 & 0 \end{pmatrix}$.**
   ??? success "Solution"
       This is a circulant matrix with first row $(0, 1, 0)$. The eigenvalues are the roots of unity: $1, \omega, \omega^2$ where $\omega = e^{2\pi i/3}$.

4. **[Convolution] Explain why multiplying a circulant matrix by a vector is equivalent to circular convolution.**
   ??? success "Solution"
       The entry $(Cx)_i = \sum c_{(j-i) \pmod n} x_j$, which is precisely the formula for the circular convolution of the sequences $c$ and $x$. Using the FFT, this operation can be performed in $O(n \log n)$.

5. **[Inversion] What is the complexity of inverting an $n 	imes n$ Toeplitz matrix?**
   ??? success "Solution"
       While general inversion is $O(n^3)$, the Levinson-Durbin or Bareiss algorithms can invert Toeplitz matrices in $O(n^2)$. Even faster algorithms exist ($O(n \log^2 n)$) using displacement structure.

6. **[Commutativity] Prove that all $n 	imes n$ circulant matrices commute with each other.**
   ??? success "Solution"
       Since all circulant matrices are diagonalized by the same unitary matrix $F$, they all commute: $C_1 C_2 = (F^* \Lambda_1 F)(F^* \Lambda_2 F) = F^* (\Lambda_1 \Lambda_2) F = F^* (\Lambda_2 \Lambda_1) F = C_2 C_1$.

7. **[Stationary Processes] In statistics, how do Toeplitz matrices relate to stationary random processes?**
   ??? success "Solution"
       The covariance matrix of a wide-sense stationary (WSS) discrete-time process is Toeplitz, because the covariance $E[X_t X_{t+k}]$ depends only on the lag $k$, not on the absolute time $t$.

8. **[Spectral Density] State the Szegő Limit Theorem in simple terms.**
   ??? success "Solution"
       As $n 	o \infty$, the distribution of eigenvalues of a Toeplitz matrix generated by a function $f(	heta)$ converges to the distribution of values of the function $f$. This connects the discrete spectrum to the continuous power spectral density.

9. **[Vandermonde] Relate circulant matrices to Vandermonde matrices.**
   ??? success "Solution"
       The DFT matrix $F$ is a special type of Vandermonde matrix whose nodes are the $n$-th roots of unity.

10. **[Product] Is the product of two Toeplitz matrices always Toeplitz?**
    ??? success "Solution"
        No. Unlike circulant matrices, the set of Toeplitz matrices is not closed under multiplication. However, the product of two circulant matrices *is* circulant.

## Chapter Summary

This chapter explores matrices defined by shift-invariant structures:

1. **Shift Symmetry**: Defined Toeplitz, Hankel, and circulant matrices as representations of linear interactions with varying degrees of displacement invariance.
2. **Fourier Duality**: Established circulant matrices as the algebraic dual of the DFT, enabling super-fast convolution.
3. **Recursive Inversion**: Outlined algorithms like Levinson-Durbin that exploit structural redundancy for quadratic-time solving.
4. **Asymptotic Analysis**: Linked the spectral properties of large Toeplitz matrices to continuous frequency-domain functions via Szegő theory.
