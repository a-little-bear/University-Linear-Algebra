<div class="context-flow" markdown>

**Prerequisites**: Vector Spaces (Ch4) · Orthogonality (Ch7) · Quadratic Forms (Ch9) · Exterior Algebra (Ch49)

**Chapter Outline**: Geometric Product $uv$ → Fundamental Identity $v^2 = Q(v)$ → Bivectors and Grade → Spin Groups → Rotors and Sandwich Products → Relation to Complex Numbers and Quaternions → Dirac Algebra → Spinors

**Extension**: Clifford algebra, also known as **Geometric Algebra**, provides a unified framework for geometry and physics, encompassing rotations in any dimension and the Dirac equation in quantum mechanics.

</div>

Clifford algebra generalizes complex numbers, quaternions, and exterior algebra into a single coordinate-independent framework. By defining the **geometric product**, it allows for the division of vectors and the representation of rotations as simple sandwich products. This algebraic structure is particularly powerful in describing rotations and reflections in $n$ dimensions without the singularities of Euler angles.

## 50.1 The Geometric Product

!!! definition "Definition 50.1 (Geometric Product)"
    The geometric product $uv$ of two vectors is defined by the fundamental identity:
    $$v^2 = Q(v) \cdot \mathbb{1}$$
    where $Q(v)$ is a quadratic form. For orthogonal vectors $u \perp v$, the product anticommutes: $uv = -vu$.

!!! theorem "Theorem 50.1 (Decomposition)"
    The geometric product of two vectors $u, v$ can be decomposed into a symmetric scalar part and an antisymmetric bivector part:
    $$uv = u \cdot v + u \wedge v$$
    The scalar part $u \cdot v$ is the inner product, and the bivector part $u \wedge v$ is the exterior product.

## Exercises

1. **[Fundamentals] In $\mathcal{Cl}_{2,0}(\mathbb{R})$, compute $(e_1 + e_2)^2$ where $e_1^2 = 1, e_2^2 = 1$ and $e_1 \perp e_2$.**
   ??? success "Solution"
       $(e_1 + e_2)^2 = e_1^2 + e_1 e_2 + e_2 e_1 + e_2^2 = 1 + e_1 e_2 - e_1 e_2 + 1 = 2$. This reflects the identity $v^2 = |v|^2$ for Euclidean metrics.

2. **[Complex Numbers] Show that $\mathcal{Cl}_{0,1}(\mathbb{R})$ is isomorphic to the complex numbers $\mathbb{C}$.**
   ??? success "Solution"
       The algebra is generated by $\mathbb{1}$ and $e_1$ with $e_1^2 = -1$. Mapping $e_1 \mapsto i$ establishes the isomorphism, where the geometric product matches complex multiplication.

3. **[Quaternions] Show that the even subalgebra $\mathcal{Cl}_{3,0}^+(\mathbb{R})$ is isomorphic to the quaternions $\mathbb{H}$.**
   ??? success "Solution"
       The even subalgebra is spanned by $\{1, e_1 e_2, e_2 e_3, e_3 e_1\}$. Let $I = e_2 e_3, J = e_3 e_1, K = e_1 e_2$. Then $I^2 = J^2 = K^2 = IJK = -1$, which are the defining relations of $\mathbb{H}$.

4. **[Rotors] Define a rotor $R$ and describe its action on a vector $v$.**
   ??? success "Solution"
       A rotor is an element of the spin group, typically $R = e^{B/2}$ where $B$ is a bivector. Its action is given by the sandwich product $v' = R v R^{-1}$. This represents a rotation in the plane of $B$ by an angle $|B|$.

5. **[Reflection] Express the reflection of a vector $v$ across a hyperplane with unit normal $n$ using the geometric product.**
   ??? success "Solution"
       The reflection is $v' = -n v n^{-1}$. Since $n$ is a unit vector ($n^2=1$), this simplifies to $v' = -n v n$. The parallel component $v_\parallel$ is mapped to $-v_\parallel$, and the perpendicular component $v_\perp$ is unchanged.

6. **[Bivectors] What is the geometric interpretation of a bivector $u \wedge v$?**
   ??? success "Solution"
       A bivector represents an oriented plane segment. Its magnitude corresponds to the area of the parallelogram spanned by $u$ and $v$, and its orientation corresponds to the plane itself with a directed sense of rotation.

7. **[Dirac Matrices] Relate the Dirac $\gamma$ matrices to Clifford algebra.**
   ??? success "Solution"
       The Dirac matrices are a matrix representation of the generators of $\mathcal{Cl}_{1,3}(\mathbb{R})$ (spacetime algebra). They satisfy the anticommutation relations $\{\gamma_\mu, \gamma_\nu\} = 2\eta_{\mu\nu}I$.

8. **[Inversion] Prove that a vector $v$ has a multiplicative inverse if and only if $Q(v) \neq 0$.**
   ??? success "Solution"
       From $v^2 = Q(v)$, we have $v(v/Q(v)) = \mathbb{1}$. Thus $v^{-1} = v/Q(v)$. If $Q(v)=0$ (a null vector), no inverse exists within the algebra.

9. **[Grade] Define the grade of an element in a Clifford algebra.**
   ??? success "Solution"
       The grade is the number of basis vectors in the product forming the element. Scalars are grade 0, vectors are grade 1, bivectors are grade 2, etc. A general element is a multivector (sum of different grades).

10. **[Spinors] Describe the algebraic definition of a spinor in terms of the Clifford algebra.**
    ??? success "Solution"
        Algebraically, spinors are elements of a minimal left ideal of the Clifford algebra. They transform under the spin group via left multiplication $s' = Rs$, which distinguishes them from the sandwich product used for vectors.

## Chapter Summary

This chapter unifies algebraic and geometric structures through Clifford algebra:

1. **Geometric Calculus**: Defined the geometric product as the synthesis of inner and exterior products, enabling vector division.
2. **Rotational Symmetry**: Formulated rotations and reflections via rotors and sandwich products, providing a singularity-free alternative to Euler angles.
3. **Subalgebra Mapping**: Established isomorphisms between Clifford algebras and classical systems like $\mathbb{C}$ and $\mathbb{H}$.
4. **Physical Interplay**: Linked the algebraic properties of multivectors to relativistic physics and quantum mechanics (spinors).
